##  Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes electric vehicle adoption trends in the United States using vehicle registration data. It provides valuable insights into the growth of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), regional distribution, manufacturer dominance, eligibility for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives, and more.

##  Problem Statement

The aim of this project is to assess the growth, technological advancements, and distribution of electric vehicles across the US by examining:

**KPI's Requirement**

1. **Total Vehicles**: Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs, to assess the market's size and growth.
2. **Average Electric Range**: Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge technological advancements and efficiency of EVs.
3. **Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles**
   - Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs).
   - Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of EVs, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.

4. **Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles**
   - Identify and analyze the total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
   - Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of EVs, offering insights into the market share of hybrid models

# ðŸ“Š Visualizations

- **Total Vehicles by Model Year (From 2010 Onwards)**: Track adoption growth over time.
- **Total Vehicles by State**: Understand EV distribution across different states.
- **Top 10 Total Vehicles by Make**: Identify leading manufacturers in the EV space.
- **Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility**: Show the share of vehicles eligible for clean fuel incentives.
- **Top 10 Total Vehicles by Model**: Visualize the most popular EV models among users.
  
## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Excel/CSV**: Initial dataset formatting
- **DAX**: Custom metrics and calculations
- **Geospatial Mapping**: Used map visuals for state-wise distribution

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

- The majority of EVs registered are BEVs, indicating a strong preference for fully electric vehicles.
- Tesla dominates both in terms of total make and popular models (e.g., Model 3).
- Adoption trends have increased significantly post-2017.
- Certain regions/states lead in EV registrations, possibly due to policy incentives or urban preferences.
- CAFV eligibility plays a role in adoption, with a notable portion of EVs qualifying for incentives.

## âœ… Recommendations

1. **Encourage CAFV Incentives**: Promote clean fuel vehicle programs to accelerate EV adoption, especially in underrepresented states.

2. **Targeted Manufacturer Partnerships**: Collaborate with top OEMs like Tesla and Nissan to improve service centers, charging infrastructure, and marketing campaigns.

3. **Boost Awareness in Low-Adoption Areas**: Launch state-wise educational campaigns and offer subsidies to raise interest in EVs.

4. **Enhance Electric Range in PHEVs**: Encourage R&D investments for hybrid models to match BEV efficiency and extend driving range.

5. **Expand Charging Infrastructure**: Use state-wise EV data to prioritize new charging station installations in high-density regions.

6. **Monitor Trends Post-2017**: The surge in EV adoption after 2017 needs continuous monitoring to evaluate long-term sustainability and forecast future demand.
